**Previous Version:** 1.1.0

## Overview

Version 1.3 delivers **extensive world-building depth** centered around **writing systems as the foundation of cultural identity**. This update transforms Arikuri into a fully immersive total conversion with rich lore, authentic cultural mechanics, and substantial audio-visual polish.

### Core Philosophy: Writing Systems as Cultural Identity

Writing systems are no longer cosmetic - they define **religious families**, **government types**, **heraldic aesthetics**, and **cultural mechanics**. Each of the 4 polished writing systems (Plith, Queekwa, Gleuncti, Pfaunkti) now has complete visual identity, mechanical depth, and lore integration.
