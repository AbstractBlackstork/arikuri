## The Writing System Philosophy

In Arikuri, **script is destiny**. Your civilization's writing system isn't decoration - it's the lens through which your people understand reality:

- **Faith** - Religious families share script, language, worldview
- **Governance** - Government types reflect cultural values encoded in writing
- **Heraldry** - Coats of arms express identity through script-specific symbolism
- **Mechanics** - Unique activities and events tied to cultural traditions

Play as **Plith** and hunt heresy through inquisitorial investigations.  
Build a **maritime empire** with Aigl's naval-focused government.  
Inherit **ancient beauty** through Appa bloodlines.  

Every playthrough reveals different facets of this alien world's depth.
